<!-- About Section -->
<div class="w3-container" style="padding:128px 16px" id="about">
  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT CLOUD CONSULTING</h3>
  <p class="w3-center w3-large">Cloud Consulting is a firm that specializes in custom-made web design services. We utilize the use of freelancers to complete our
  client contracts. For certain projects or if requested by our clients we also provide in-house web development.  
Whether you are an individual or small business we take pride in our ability to help you achieve your goals by designing
well-structured and fully functional websites that will boost your presence online. We are a freelancing service with
our web designer as project manager. We also have other core members of our staff that facilitate the exchange of
information and coordination between our client and designer. We specialize in working with small businesses
and individuals. As our team is small and, aside from our own in-house lead designer, comprised mostly of freelance designers, we usually do not take on contracts with
larger firms or projects that require multiple designers.</p>

      <i class="fa fa-desktop w3-margin-bottom w3-jumbo w3-center" alt="Desktop"></i>
      <p class="w3-large">Platform</p>
      <p>The platforms in which we work with to develop websites for clients include wordpress, wix, magento and joomla.
We also use various codes including html, css, javascript, php to build the website. Overall we use the latest tools 
and techniques that are in demand or expected of within the current digital environment to build
a well functional and appropriate website.</p>

      <p>We here at Cloud Consulting feel that passion is the most important and fundamental characteristic of

      <i class="fa fa-diamond w3-margin-bottom w3-jumbo" alt="Diamond"></i>
      <p class="w3-large">Cost</p>
      <p>It varies from client to client. If you are looking for something simple then it will be much less naturally,
usually around $150+ but something that requires much more functionality such as SEO and e-commerce then it will
cost much more. Other things such as revisions and number of domains will also affect the price. We have a general summary of
the prices in our services section.</p>

e-mail, phone, or in person. You can also reach us at our social media platforms if you desire.
